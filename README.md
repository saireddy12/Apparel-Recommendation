Objective:
 </h2>
The recommendation engine, uses information about 1,80,000 products and each product will have multiple features.
tried multiple techniques using title , brand ,color ,type  and image to recommend similar products/items
Each item has 19 features in the raw dataset out of these 19 features, I used only 6 features(excluding ID(asin)) <br>                                                                         
*The features used in creating the recommendation engine are:*

<ol type="1">
  <li>asin ( Amazon standard identification number) </li>
  <li>brand ( brand to which the product belongs to )</li>
  <li>color ( Color information of apparel, it can contain many colors as a value ex: red and black stripes )</li>
